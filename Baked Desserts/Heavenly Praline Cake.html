    <p> 1. Preheat oven to 325°. In a large bowl, beat egg white until foamy. Add pecan halves; stir gently to coat. Combine sugar and brown sugar; add to pecan mixture and stir gently to coat.
        <br> 2. Spread into 2 greased 15x10x1-in. baking pans. Bake 18-22 minutes, stirring once. Cool. Store in an airtight container for up to 1 week.<br> 3. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, cream butter, 
        cream cheese and brown sugar until light and fluffy, 5-7 minutes. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in vanilla. Combine flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt; 
        add to the creamed mixture alternately with sour cream, beating well after each addition. Stir in chopped pecans.<br> 4. Transfer to a greased and floured 10-in. fluted tube pan.
        Bake at 325° until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 60-70 minutes. Cool 10 minutes before removing from pan to a wire rack to cool completely.<br> 5. For icing, in a small saucepan, combine brown sugar,
        butter and milk. Bring to a boil; cook and stir 1 minute longer. Remove from heat; stir in confectioners' sugar and vanilla until smooth. Drizzle over cake. Serve with candied pecans.
