        <b>Directions:</b>
        <ol>
          <li>To prepare crust: Preheat oven to 350Â°F. Position rack in lower third of oven. Wrap the outside of a 9-inch spring form pan with 2 layers of heavy-duty foil; 
            coat the inside of the pan with cooking spray. Stir graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, 2 tablespoons sugar and 1/4 teaspoon salt together in a medium bowl until evenly combined. 
            Transfer to the prepared pan, pressing the mixture into the bottom of the pan. Bake until set and light golden, 8 to 12 minutes. Let cool on a wire rack for 30 minutes (do not turn off the oven)</li>
          <li>Meanwhile, prepare cheesecake filling: Combine cream cheese and 2/3 cup sugar in a large bowl. Beat with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. 
            Add eggs, one at a time, beating on low just until combined after each addition. Beat in 3 tablespoons flour and 1/4 teaspoon salt on low speed just until combined. Beat in preserves and vanilla on 
            low speed just until combined. Fold in peaches just until combined.</li>
          <li>Pour the filling into the cooled crust. Gently jiggle the pan to smooth the top. Place the cheesecake in a large roasting pan; 
            place on the rack in the bottom third of the oven. Pour warm water into the roasting pan to come halfway up the sides (do not let water get into the foil wrapping). 
            Bake until the cheesecake is just set on top, about 35 minutes.</li>
          <li> Meanwhile, prepare topping: Combine butter and sugar in a medium bowl; beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until light and fluffy, 
            about 1 minute. Add flour, baking powder, cinnamon and salt, beating on low speed just until combined. Beat in 2 tablespoons water on low speed until combined.</li>
          <li> Open oven door and carefully slide out the rack with the cheesecake.
            Carefully dollop teaspoonfuls of topping over the cheesecake. Carefully slide the rack back in and close the oven. Continue baking until the topping is golden and the cheesecake is almost set in the center, about 1 hour. 
            Turn the oven off and prop the oven door ajar 1 to 3 inches. Let the cheesecake stand in the oven for 1 hour.</li>
          <li>Remove the cheesecake from the roasting pan and remove the foil from the outside of the springform pan.
            Refrigerate, uncovered, for at least 6 hours and up to 12 hours. Gently run a small offset spatula around the edges and remove the pan sides. Garnish with peach slices and warmed peach preserves, if desired.</li>
