      <b>Ingredients:</b>
        <li>6 cups strawberry sorbet, divided</li>
        <li>7 cups Strawberry Gelato or favorite store-bought gelato or ice cream, divided</li>
        <li>6 cups Sour Cream Gelato or favorite store-bought gelato or ice cream</li>
        <li>1 quart strawberries, washed, or favorite ice cream toppings and decorations</li>
        <li>4 pounds fresh strawberries (about 16 cups), hulled and quartered</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups granulated sugar</li>
    </ul>

        <b>Directions:</b>
       
        <ol> 
          <b>Make the Strawberry Sorbet:</b>
          <li> Using a potato masher, mash strawberries in a large bowl until mostly pureed (there will still be small chunks of pulverized berries) to yield about 6 cups strawberry puree. Stir sugar into berry puree. Cover and refrigerate until well chilled, at least 1 hour.</li>
          <li> Pour half of the chilled strawberry mixture into the freezer bowl of a 1 1/2-quart electric ice cream maker, and proceed according to the manufacturer's instructions.</li>
          <li>Transfer sorbet to a freezer-safe container; press a sheet of parchment paper directly on surface, and seal with an airtight lid. Place in freezer. Repeat procedure with remaining chilled strawberry mixture. Freeze sorbet at least 8 hours or overnight.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol> <b>Make the Cake:</b>
            <li> Scoop 3 cups strawberry sorbet into a large bowl. Using head of ice cream scoop, break up the sorbet. Once it begins to melt around edges, fold sorbet with a flexible spatula until smooth, spreadable, and still holds its shape, like smooth peanut butter.</li>
            <li> Using a large offset spatula, spread the softened sorbet evenly in a round 9-inch (12-cup) springform pan, spreading to edges. Use flat side of a plastic bowl scraper to smooth surface. Place a 9-inch round sheet of parchment paper directly on the surface; freeze 45 minutes.</li>
            <li> Repeat Step 1 with 3 cups Strawberry Gelato. Peel parchment off sorbet layer; spread Strawberry Gelato over sorbet, and smooth with bowl scraper. Cover with parchment; freeze 45 minutes.</li>
            <li> Repeat softening and layering procedures with 3 cups strawberry sorbet and 3 cups Strawberry Gelato, freezing between layers. On final Strawberry Gelato layer, fill pan to top, using an additional 1 cup Strawberry Gelato; smooth and level with bowl scraper. Cover with a 9- x 13-inch sheet of parchment. Freeze 8 hours.</li>
            <li> To unmold, dampen a kitchen towel with hot water; wrap around pan to release cake from sides of pan. Remove parchment and pan sides. Replace parchment, and invert cake onto a cutting board or cookie sheet. Freeze 1 hour.</li>
            <li> Repeat Step 1 with 6 cups Sour Cream Gelato. Mound 4 cups softened Sour Cream Gelato on top of cake. Using a large offset spatula, frost cake with gelato evenly over top and just past edges of cake. Using parchment to turn cake, frost cake sides with remaining 2 cups Sour Cream Gelato. Use bowl scraper to smooth top and sides of cake. Return to freezer; freeze at least 4 hours before serving.</li>
            <li> Transfer cake to refrigerator for 10 minutes before cutting. Slide cake from parchment onto a serving plate. Garnish with 1 quart of fresh strawberries. Slice and serve immediately.</li>
